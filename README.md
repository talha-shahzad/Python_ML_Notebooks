# Python ML Tasks

This repository contains various machine learning and data manipulation tasks implemented in Python using Jupyter Notebooks within the Anaconda environment. Each task demonstrates specific concepts and methodologies in machine learning and data analysis, providing a hands-on approach to understanding these techniques.

## Tasks Included

### Jupyter Notebook Tasks:
- **Linear Regression**: Demonstrates simple linear regression, exploring relationships between variables and predicting outcomes.
- **Polynomial Regression**: Covers regression models that use polynomial features to capture non-linear relationships.
- **Multi-linear Regression**: Implements regression models with multiple predictors.
- **Co-linearity**: Analyzes the effects of co-linearity among predictor variables and how it impacts model performance.
- **Logistic Regression**: Focuses on classification problems using logistic regression models.
- **Lasso Regularization**: Explores feature selection and model regularization using the Lasso method.
- **DFS and BFS**: Working and implementation of depth first and breath first searches.
- **Genatic Algorithm**: Real-life Examples of Genetic algoritm.
- **A-star and Alpha/Beta pruning**: Game based examples of A-star and alpha/beta pruning.
